# Summary

`plotastic` addresses the challenges of transitioning from exploratory
data analysis to hypothesis testing in Python's data science ecosystem.
Bridging the gap between `seaborn` and `pingouin`, this library offers a
unified environment for plotting and statistical analysis. It simplifies
the workflow with a user-friendly syntax and seamless integration with
familiar `seaborn` parameters (y, x, hue, row, col). Inspired by
`seaborn`'s consistency, `plotastic` utilizes a `DataAnalysis` object to
intelligently pass parameters to `pingouin` statistical functions. The
library systematically groups the data according to the needs of
statistical tests and plots, conducts visualisation, analyses and
supports extensive customization options. In essence, `plotastic`
establishes a protocol for configuring statical analyses through
plotting parameters. This approach streamlines the process, translating
`seaborn` parameters into statistical terms, providing researchers and
data scientists with a cohesive and user-friendly solution in python.

# Statement of need

Python's data science ecosystem provides powerful tools for both
visualization and statistical testing. However, the transition from
exploratory data analysis to hypothesis testing can be cumbersome,
requiring users to switch between libraries and adapt to different
syntaxes.

`seaborn` has become a popular choice for plotting in Python, offering
an intuitive interface. Its statistical functionality focuses on
descriptive plots and bootstrapped confidence intervals.
[@waskomSeabornStatisticalData2021]. The library `pingouin` offers an
extensive set of statistical tests, but it lacks integration with common
plotting capabilities [@vallatPingouinStatisticsPython2018].
`statannotations` integrates statistical testing with plot annotations, but
 uses a complex interface and is limited to pairwise comparisons.
 [@charlierTrevismdStatannotationsV02022].

`plotastic` addresses this gap by offering a unified environment for
plotting and statistical analysis. With an emphasis on user-friendly
syntax and integration with familiar `seaborn` parameters, it simplifies
the process for users already comfortable `seaborn`. The library ensures
a smooth workflow, from data import to hypothesis testing and
visualization.

# Example
The following code demonstrates how `plotastic` analyzes the
example dataset "fmri", similar to @waskomSeabornStatisticalData2021. 

```python
### IMPORT PLOTASTIC
import plotastic as plst

# IMPORT EXAMPLE DATA
DF, _dims = plst.load_dataset("fmri", verbose = False)

# EXPLICITLY DEFINE DIMENSIONS TO FACET BY
dims = dict(
    y = "signal",    # y-axis, dependent variable
    x = "timepoint", # x-axis, independent variable (within-subject factor)
    hue = "event",   # color,  independent variable (within-subject factor)
    col = "region"   # axes,   grouping variable
)

# INITIALIZE DATAANALYSIS OBJECT
DA = plst.DataAnalysis(
    data=DF,           # Dataframe, long format
    dims=dims,         # Dictionary with y, x, hue, col, row 
    subject="subject", # Datapoints are paired by subject (optional)
    verbose=False,     # Print out info about the Data (optional)
)

# STATISTICAL TESTS
DA.check_normality()   # Check Normality
DA.check_sphericity()  # Check Sphericity
DA.omnibus_rm_anova()  # Perform RM-ANOVA
DA.test_pairwise()     # Perform Posthoc Analysis

# PLOTTING
(DA
 .plot_box_strip()   # Pre-built plotting function initializes plot
 .annotate_pairwise( # Annotate results from DA.test_pairwise()
     include="__HUE" # Use only significant pairs across each hue
     ) 
)
```

:Results from `DA.check_sphericity()`. `plotastic` assesses sphericity
after grouping the data by all grouping dimensions (hue, row, col). For
example, `DA.check_sphericity()` grouped the 'fmri' dataset by "region"
(col) and "event" (hue), performing four subsequent sphericity tests for
four datasets. []{label="tab:sphericity"} \label{tab:sphericity}

grouped the 'fmri' dataset by "region" (col), performing two subsequent
two-factor RM-ANOVAs. Within-factors are "timepoint" (x) and "event"
(hue). For conciceness, GG-Correction and effect sizes are not shown.

# Overview


The functionality of `plotastic` revolves around a seamless integration
of statistical analysis and plotting, leveraging the capabilities of
`pingouin`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib` and `statannotations`.
[@vallatPingouinStatisticsPython2018; @waskomSeabornStatisticalData2021;
@hunterMatplotlib2DGraphics2007, @charlierTrevismdStatannotationsV02022
]. It utilizes long-format `pandas` `DataFrames` as its primary input,
aligning with the conventions of `seaborn` and ensuring compatibility
with existing data structures [@wickhamTidyData2014a;
@mckinneyPandasFoundationalPython2011].

`plotastic` was inspired by `seaborn`'s intuitive and consistent usage
of the same set of parameters (y, x, hue, row, col) found in each of its
plotting functions [@waskomSeabornStatisticalData2021]. These parameters
intuitively delineate the data dimensions plotted, yielding 'facetted'
subplots, each presenting y against x. This allows for rapid and
insightful exploration of multidimensional relationships. `plotastic`
extends this principle to statistical analysis by storing these
 `seaborn` parameters (referred to as dimensions) in a `DataAnalysis`
object and intelligently passing them to statistical functions of the
`pingouin` library. This approach is based on the impression that most
decisions during statistical analysis can be derived from how the user
decides to arrange the data in a plot. This approach also prevents code
repetition and streamlines statistical analysis. For example, the
subject keyword is specified only once during `DataAnalysis`
initialisation, and `plotastic` selects the appropriate paired or
unpaired version of the test. Using `pingouin` alone requires the user to
manually pick the correct test and to repeatedly specify the subject
keyword in each testing function.

In essence, `plotastic` translates plotting parameters into their
statistical counterparts. This translation minimizes user input and also
ensures a coherent and logical connection between plotting and
statistical analysis. The goal is to allow the user to focus on choosing
the correct statistical test (e.g. parametric vs. non-parametric) and
worry less about specific implementations.

At its core, `plotastic` employs iterators to systematically group data
based on various dimensions, aligning the analysis with the distinct
requirements of tests and plots. Normality testing is performed on each
individual sample, which is achieved by splitting the data by all
grouping dimensions and also the x-axis (hue, row, col, x). Sphericity
and homoscedasticity testing is performed on a complete sampleset listed
on the x-axis, which is achieved by splitting the data by all grouping
dimensions (hue, row, col)  (\autoref{tab:sphericity}). For omnibus and
posthoc analyses, data is grouped by the row and col dimensions in
parallel to the `matplotlib` axes, before performing one two-factor
analysis per axes using x and hue as the within/between-factors.
(\autoref{tab:RMANOVA}).

`DataAnalysis` visualizes data through predefined plotting functions
designed for drawing multi-layered plots. A notable emphasis within
`plotastic` is placed on showcasing individual datapoints alongside
aggregated means or medians. In detail, each plotting function
initializes `matplotlib` figure and axes using `plt.subplots()` while
returning a `DataAnalysis` object for method chaining. Axes are
populated by `seaborn` plotting functions (e.g., `sns.boxplot()`),
leveraging automated aggregation and error bar displays. Keyword
arguments are passed to these `seaborn` functions, ensuring the same
degree of customization as in seaborn. Users can further customize plots
by chaining `DataAnalysis` methods or by applying common `matplotlib` code
to override plotastic settings. Figures are exported using
`plt.savefig()`. 

`plotastic` also focuses on in annotating statistical information within
plots, seamlessly incorporating p-values from pairwise comparisons using
`statannotations` [@charlierTrevismdStatannotationsV02022]. This
integration simplifies the interface and expands options for pair
selection in multidimensional plots, enhancing both user experience and
interpretability.

`plotastic` also focuses on annotating statistical inside the plot. It integrates `statannotations` for annotating p-values
 from pairwise comparisons inside the plot
 [@charlierTrevismdStatannotationsV02022], and simplifies the interface
 and offering further options for pair selection in multidimensional
 plots.

For statistics, `plotastic` integrates with the `pingouin` library to
support classical assumption and hypothesis testing, covering
parametric/non-parametric and paired/non-paired variants. Assumptions
such as normality, homoscedasticity, and sphericity are tested. Omnibus
tests include two-factor RM-ANOVA, ANOVA, Friedman, and Kruskal-Wallis.
Posthoc tests are implemented through `pingouin.pairwise_tests()`,
offering (paired) t-tests, Wilcoxon, and Mann-Whitney-U.

To sum up, plotastic stands as a unified and user-friendly solution
catering to the needs of researchers and data scientists, seamlessly
integrating statistical analysis with the power of plotting in Python.
It streamlines the workflow, translates `seaborn` parameters into
statistical terms, and supports extensive customization options for both
analysis and visualization.
